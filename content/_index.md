## :wave: Hola
I'm Harish. My work is largely centered around,

### :computer: Software engineering
I'm a software engineer by profession and my work experience ranges from developing cross-platform desktop applications, end to end automation workflows and developing RESTful API's and backend services.

More recently, I have taken a keen interest in developer productivity - through developer tooling and software builds & release workflows.

Check out some of my {{< external text="projects on Github" url="https://github.com/tinvaan" >}} and leave any feedback you may have.


### :rocket: Early stage startups
I started out as an integration engineer at {{< external text="Spectral Insights" url="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectral-insights/" >}}(acquired by {{< external text="nference Inc" url="https://nference.ai" >}} when the team was _< 20_ in size.

I was also the __first engineering hire__ at {{< external text="Anapi" url="https://anapi.co" >}} and helped build Anapi's digital insurance API from the ground-up during my time there. I was directly reporting to the CTO and worked closely with the product management throughout.

Following a stint as a __Member of Technical Staff__ at {{< external text="ColorTokens" url="https://colortokens.com" >}}, where I maintained a real-time monitoring service for customer assets on public clouds, viz. {{< external text="AWS" url="https://aws.amazon.com" >}} & {{< external text="Azure" url="https://azure.microsoft.com" >}}. This was an important part of ColorTokens' _CSPM_ solution.

Currently, I'm part of the integrations team at {{< external text="Dialpad" url="https://dialpad.com" >}} where I build strategic integrations to help expand Dialpad's {{< external text="app marketplace" url="https://www.dialpad.com/app-marketplace" >}}. I've' also driven efforts to improve the developer productivity for integrations team members and external vendors by packaging SDK's, migrating CI workflows to Github {{< external text="Actions" url="https://github.com/features/actions" >}} and automating beta release processes via the same, to mention a few.

### :open_file_folder: Open source software
I've worked on projects of the {{< external text="KDE community" url="https://kde.org" >}} such as {{< external text="Kopete" url="https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete" >}}, {{< external text="Plasma Mediacenter" url="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center" >}} and {{< external text="Plasma Public Transport" url="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport" >}} as part of the {{< external text="Google Summer of Code" url="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">}} program in 2015 & 2016, while some of my recent work is accessible publicly on my {{< external text="Github" url="https://github.com/tinvaan" >}} profile.


<!-- I've worked on a few projects of the {{< external text="KDE community" url="https://kde.org" >}}, initially working on the {{< external text="Plasma Mediacenter" url="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center" >}} project and further onwards, porting & rewriting the {{< external text="Kopete" url="https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete" >}} and {{< external text="Plasma Public Transport" url="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport" >}} applets to {{< external text="KF5" url="https://techbase.kde.org/KDE_Frameworks" >}} libraries, as part of my {{< external text="Google Summer of Code" url="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" >}} projects in 2015 & 2016. -->

I also organized the first ever {{< external text="conf.kde.in" url="https://dot.kde.org/2015/03/04/confkdein-2015-divine" >}} to take place in south India in 2015, after having organized a _DebUtsav_ the previous year, which featured on the {{< external text="Debian newsletter" url="https://debian.org/News/weekly/2014/14/#DebUtsav14" >}}.

I've also presented my work at various national and international conferences in the past. Head over to the [talks](/talks) page for more.
