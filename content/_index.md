## :wave: Hola
I'm Harish. My work is largely centered around

### :computer: Software engineering
As a software developer/engineer, my experience ranges from developing cross-platform desktop applications to developing RESTful API's and backend services.

More recently, I have taken a keen interest in developer productivity - through developer tooling and software builds & release workflows.

Check out some of my {{< external text="projects on Github" url="https://github.com/tinvaan" >}} and leave any feedback you may have.


### :rocket: Early stage startups
I started out as an __integration engineer__ at {{< external text="Spectral Insights" url="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectral-insights/" >}}(acquired by {{< external text="nference Inc" url="https://nference.ai" >}} when the team was _< 20_ in size.

I was also the __first engineering hire__ at {{< external text="Anapi" url="https://anapi.co" >}} and helped build Anapi's digital insurance API from the ground-up during my time there. I was directly reporting to the CTO and worked closely with the product management throughout.

Currently, I'm a __Member of Technical Staff__ at {{< external text="ColorTokens" url="https://colortokens.com" >}}, a mid-level network security startup, where I maintain a real-time monitoring service for customer assets on public clouds, viz. {{< external text="AWS" url="https://aws.amazon.com" >}} & {{< external text="Azure" url="https://azure.microsoft.com" >}}.

### :open_file_folder: Open source software
I'm a huge proponent of open source software projects and I love engaging with such software communities. As an undergraduate student at {{< external text="Amrita University" url="https://amrita.edu" >}}, I was an active member of the {{< external text="Free and Open Source Software(FOSS) club" url="https://amfoss.in" >}} on campus and helped organize several events and meetups for students.

Most notably, I organized the first ever {{< external text="conf.kde.in" url="https://dot.kde.org/2015/03/04/confkdein-2015-divine" >}} to take place in south India in 2015, after having organized a _DebUtsav_ the previous year, which featured on the {{< external text="Debian newsletter" url="https://debian.org/News/weekly/2014/14/#DebUtsav14" >}}.

On the technical front, I contributed to projects of the {{< external text="KDE community" url="https://kde.org" >}}, initially working on the {{< external text="Plasma Mediacenter" url="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center" >}} project and further onwards, porting & rewriting the {{< external text="Kopete" url="https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete" >}} and {{< external text="Plasma Public Transport" url="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport" >}} applets to {{< external text="KF5" url="https://techbase.kde.org/KDE_Frameworks" >}} libraries, as part of my {{< external text="Google Summer of Code" url="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" >}} projects in 2015 & 2016.

I've also presented my work at various national and international conferences in the past. Head over to the [talks](/talks) page for more.
