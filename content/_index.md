## :wave: Hola
I'm Harish. My work is largely centered around

### :computer: Software engineering
As a software developer/engineer, my experience ranges from developing cross-platform desktop applications to developing RESTful API's and backend services.

More recently, I have taken a keen interest in developer productivity - through developer tooling and software builds & relase workflows.

Check out some of my [projects on Github](https://github.com/tinvaan) and leave any feedback you may have.


### :rocket: Early stage startups
I started out as an __integration engineer__ at [Spectral Insights](https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectral-insights/)(acquired by [nference Inc](https://nference.ai)) when the team was _< 20_ memebers.

I was also the __first engineering hire__ at [Anapi](https://anapi.co) and helped build Anapi's digital insurance API from the ground-up during my time there. I was directly reporting to the CTO and worked closely with the product management throughout.

Currently, I'm a __Member of Technical Staff__ at [ColorTokens](https://colortokens.com), a mid-level network security startup, where I maintain a real-time monitoring service for customer assets on the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud.

### :open_file_folder: Open source software
I'm a huge proponent of open source software projects and I love engaging with such software communities. As an undergraduate student at [Amrita University](https://www.amrita.edu), I was an active member of the [Free and Open Source Software(FOSS) club](https://amfoss.in) on campus and helped organize several events and meetups for students.

Most notably, I organized the first ever [conf.kde.in](https://dot.kde.org/2015/03/04/confkdein-2015-divine) to take place in south India in 2015, after having organized a _DebUtsav_ the previous year, which featured on the [Debian newsletter](https://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2014/14/#DebUtsav14).

On the technical front, I contributed to projects of the [KDE community](https://kde.org), initially working on the [Plasma Mediacenter](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center) project and further onwards, porting & rewriting the [Kopete](https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete) and [Plasma Public Transport](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport) applets to [KF5](https://techbase.kde.org/KDE_Frameworks) libraries, as part of my [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) projects in 2015 & 2016.

I've also presented my work at various national and international conferences in the past. To find more, head over to the [talks](/talks) page for more.
