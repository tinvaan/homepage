## :wave: Hey!

I'm Harish. My work is largely centered around,

### :computer: Software engineering

I'm a software engineer by profession and my work experience ranges from developing cross-platform desktop applications, end to end automation workflows and building scalable API's and backend services.

I'm passionate about developer productivity and love building developer tooling and automation. More recently, I've shifted my focus towards Cybersecurity & AI after completing my Master's in 2024.

Check out some of my {{< external text="projects on Github" url="https://github.com/tinvaan" >}} and leave any feedback you may have.

### :rocket: Early stage startups

I started out as an integration engineer at {{< external text="Spectral Insights" url="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectral-insights/" >}}(acquired by {{< external text="nference Inc)" url="https://nference.ai" >}} when the team was _< 20_ in size.

I was also the __first engineering hire__ at {{< external text="Anapi" url="https://anapi.co" >}} and helped build Anapi's digital insurance API from the ground-up during my time there. I was directly reporting to the CTO and worked closely with the product management throughout.

Lastly, I was part of the integrations team at {{< external text="Dialpad" url="https://dialpad.com" >}} where I built strategic integrations to help expand Dialpad's {{< external text="app marketplace" url="https://www.dialpad.com/app-marketplace" >}}. I also drove efforts to improve the developer productivity for integrations team members and external vendors by packaging SDK's, migrating CI workflows to Github {{< external text="Actions" url="https://github.com/features/actions" >}} and automating beta release processes via the same, to mention a few.

### :lock: Cybersecurity

I graduated with a Master's in Cybersecurity & Design from the {{< external text="Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)" url="https://www.sutd.edu.sg/" >}} in 2024. I'm interested in developing defensive security solutions to improve SDLC workflows and implement the [shift-left](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/shift-left-security) paradigm.

I gained first-hand experience of building a security product at [ColorTokens](http://colortokens.com), where I buil the asset discovery and real-time monitoring services for [XShield](https://colortokens.com/products/xshield-microsegmentation-platform), an enterprise micro-segmentation platform.

### :open_file_folder: Open source software

I've worked on projects of the {{< external text="KDE community" url="https://kde.org" >}} such as {{< external text="Kopete" url="https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete" >}}, {{< external text="Plasma Mediacenter" url="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center" >}} and {{< external text="Plasma Public Transport" url="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport" >}} as part of the {{< external text="Google Summer of Code" url="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">}} program in 2015 & 2016, while some of my recent work is accessible publicly on my {{< external text="Github" url="https://github.com/tinvaan" >}} profile.

<!-- I've worked on a few projects of the {{< external text="KDE community" url="https://kde.org" >}}, initially working on the {{< external text="Plasma Mediacenter" url="https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_Media_Center" >}} project and further onwards, porting & rewriting the {{< external text="Kopete" url="https://kde.org/applications/en/kopete" >}} and {{< external text="Plasma Public Transport" url="https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Public_Transport" >}} applets to {{< external text="KF5" url="https://techbase.kde.org/KDE_Frameworks" >}} libraries, as part of my {{< external text="Google Summer of Code" url="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" >}} projects in 2015 & 2016. -->

I also organized the first ever {{< external text="conf.kde.in" url="https://dot.kde.org/2015/03/04/confkdein-2015-divine" >}} to take place in south India in 2015, after having organized a _DebUtsav_ the previous year, which featured on the {{< external text="Debian newsletter" url="https://debian.org/News/weekly/2014/14/#DebUtsav14" >}}.

I've also presented my work at various national and international conferences in the past. Head over to the [talks](/talks) page for more.
