I know a football team jersey, for someone who isn't an ardent follower of the sport, is an underwhelming gift to receive. Not like you were seeking or indeed expecting a gift to begin with anyway.

But ofcourse, the 5th day of June is a special one for me. Six years ago, my life changed forever.

As we enter the seventh year of having known one another, I couldn't simply let it pass by without acknowledging the importance and gratitude I feel towards you.

Though underwhelming to you, the Manchester United #7 shirt is as iconic a symbol as there is. It's a hallmark of excellence and greatness.

I’m inspired by your endeavour towards excellence. I’m certain that you’re destined for greatness and I hope to do whatever is within my capacity to help you on this journey.

Thanks for everything Appu. This means more.
